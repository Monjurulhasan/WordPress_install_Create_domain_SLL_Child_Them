SSL Installation 

To install ssl 
●	First Copy the file to the apache/crt folder if you don't have this before.
●	You should have cert.conf and make-cert.bat. These files have special code. So copy from the provided url or from your team member. 
●	Before you install a new cert, open cert.conf and change the domain name. There would be more than one domain name to change, so you have to change all of them. You can use the find and replace option of your editor. 
●	Save the file and then proceed to the next step.
●	Run the make-cert.bat
●	Give domain name, country 2 letter code, state 2 letter code, full city name, organization name, domain name, email address
●	Exit by clicking any button.
●	It will create a folder name based on your domain name. Go insider of that folder and run server.crt
●	Install  the ssl certificate and local machine as root certificate. Finish the steps .


Restart xampp apache once again. Now you can access your with or without ssl. I.e http or https versions.

If your environment isn’t wordpress then you can create a .htaccess file on the root of your server to automatically drive all traffic to https. 

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^yourdomain\.com [NC]
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://yourdomain.com/$1 [R,L]

* For reference we have used .com extension. You need to change your extension as per your setup.

To create Child Theme

#What is a Child Theme?
As indicated in the overview, a child theme inherits the look and feel of the parent theme and all of its functions, but can be used to make modifications to any part of the theme. In this way, customizations are kept separate from the parent theme’s files. Using a child theme lets you upgrade the parent theme without affecting the customizations you’ve made to your site.

1. Create a child theme folder
		First, create a new folder in your themes directory, located at wp-content/themes.
The directory needs a name. It’s best practice to give a child theme the same name as the parent, but with -child appended to the end. For example, if you were making a child theme of twentyfifteen, then the directory would be named twentyfifteen-child.

	2. Create a stylesheet: style.css
Next, you’ll need to create a stylesheet file named style.css, which will contain all of the CSS rules and declarations that control the look of your theme. Your stylesheet must contain the below required header comment at the very top of the file. This tells WordPress basic info about the theme, including the fact that it is a child theme with a particular parent.

And past the below code on your style.css file: 
/*
 Theme Name:   Twenty Fifteen Child
 Theme URI:    http://example.com/twenty-fifteen-child/
 Description:  Twenty Fifteen Child Theme
 Author:       John Doe
 Author URI:   http://example.com
 Template:     twentyfifteen
 Version:      1.0.0
 License:      GNU General Public License v2 or later
 License URI:  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
 Tags:         light, dark, two-columns, right-sidebar, responsive-layout, accessibility-ready
 Text Domain:  twentyfifteenchild
*/
And you have to change the data of the child theme from the css file theme of the main theme folder.

3. Create a functions.php file inside the child-theme folder:
	And past the below code on functions.php file:

	add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'my_theme_enqueue_styles' );
function my_theme_enqueue_styles() {
    		$parenthandle = 'parent-style'; // This is 'twentyfifteen-style' for the Twenty Fifteen theme.
    $theme = wp_get_theme();
    wp_enqueue_style( $parenthandle, get_template_directory_uri() . '/style.css', 
        array(),  // if the parent theme code has a dependency, copy it to here
        $theme->parent()->get('Version')
    );
    wp_enqueue_style( 'child-style', get_stylesheet_uri(),
        array( $parenthandle ),
        $theme->get('Version') // this only works if you have Version in the style header
    );
}

4. To view thumbnails, the original theme screenshort.jpg file must be placed inside the child-theme folder

5. Then activate your child theme.
